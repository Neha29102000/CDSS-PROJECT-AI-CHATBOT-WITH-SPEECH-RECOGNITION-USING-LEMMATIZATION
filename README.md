AI CHATBOT WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION USING LEMMATIZATION\
A chatbot is a service that people interact with via a chat interface. 
You can ask questions using your voice or by typing in the same way you would ask a person. 
The chatbot will usually respond in a conversational style, and it may carry out actions in response to your conversation (for example, order something for you).\
Dataset : http://www.whatishumanresource.com/human-resource-management \
The dataset contains everything related to Human Resource Management. 
Copy and paste the whole data in a text format.
Weâ€™ll train our model based on this data and then check how well the model performs.
Apart from this, we have also included Wikipedia python library so you can ask anything. \
To make the message understandable for a chatbot, NLP proceeds five main steps:\
1.Lexical analysis \
2.Syntactic analysis (parsing)\
3.Semantic analysis\
4.Discourse integration\
5.Pragmatic analysis\
